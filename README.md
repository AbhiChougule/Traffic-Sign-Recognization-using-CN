# Traffic-Sign-Recognization-using-CNN
•Created automated traffic sign recognition systems that serve as a vital ally for drivers, ensuring their safety
while safeguarding the well-being of fellow motorists and pedestrians.
•By harnessing these advanced functionalities, the system becomes a reliable companion, capable of
providing timely guidance and alerts to drivers, thus mitigating potential hazards on the road.
•Developed and trained a CNN model on a comprehensive dataset of traffic signs, achieving high
accuracy rates in recognizing a wide variety of sign types under different conditions.
•Conducted extensive testing to validate the system’s reliability and accuracy, focusing on reducing false
positives and improving detection speed.
• Technologies Used : Python, CNN(Convolutional Neural Network),Pandas, Numpy Tensorflow (Keras)
